# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

1. Initial Analysis and Planning
First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. Todo List Structure
The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them.
3. Plan Verification
Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Task Execution
Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Communication
Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made.
6. Simplicity Principle
Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Process Documentation
Every time you perform actions related to the project, write a log of your actions to docs/activity.md and read that file whenever you find it necessary to assist you. 
8. Review Process
Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
