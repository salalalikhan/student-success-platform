# Student Profile Challenge - Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Foundation (Following Simplified Tech Stack)
- [ ] Set up MariaDB database with schema
- [ ] Create Express.js server with minimal middleware
- [ ] Implement session-based authentication
- [ ] Set up React frontend with plain JavaScript
- [ ] Create basic project structure

## Phase 2: Student Profile Management (Core Requirement #1)
- [ ] Create student profile CRUD operations
- [ ] Store basic information (name, email, year/grade, major)
- [ ] Track academic and career goals (short-term and long-term)
- [ ] Maintain skills inventory with proficiency levels
- [ ] Record interests and extracurricular activities

## Phase 3: Dynamic Survey Tool (Core Requirement #2)
- [ ] Design survey creation interface
- [ ] Support multiple question types (multiple choice, rating scales, text responses, checkboxes)
- [ ] Allow teachers to create survey templates
- [ ] Automatically populate student profiles with survey responses
- [ ] Track survey completion rates and send reminders

## Phase 4: Resume Upload & Parsing (Core Requirement #3)
- [ ] Accept resume uploads in PDF and DOCX formats
- [ ] Extract relevant information from resumes
- [ ] Auto-populate skills and experience sections
- [ ] Store resumes securely with version history
- [ ] Flag discrepancies between uploaded resumes and survey responses

## Phase 5: Data Visualization Dashboard (Core Requirement #4)
- [ ] Display class-wide statistics on goals, interests, and skills
- [ ] Generate individual student summaries
- [ ] Create visual representations (charts, graphs) of skill distributions
- [ ] Show goal alignment across the class
- [ ] Track progress over time with historical data

## Phase 6: Search and Filter Capabilities (Core Requirement #5)
- [ ] Search students by skills, interests, or goals
- [ ] Filter students based on multiple criteria
- [ ] Group students with similar profiles for project teams
- [ ] Export filtered results for further analysis

## Technical Constraints (Must Implement)
- [ ] Web-based application accessible from modern browsers
- [ ] User authentication with role-based access (teacher vs student views)
- [ ] Data privacy and security compliance
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Data export functionality (CSV/JSON)

## Required Deliverables
- [ ] Functional web application with all core features
- [ ] Database schema design document
- [ ] Security assessment report

## AI Assistant Usage Documentation
- [ ] Document which parts of the code were AI-assisted vs. human-written
- [ ] Reflect on the effectiveness of AI assistance in final report
